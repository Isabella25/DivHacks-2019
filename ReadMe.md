This program was created to ensure no student ever has to go through the college application process without an academic role model. CollegeConnect allows high schoolers to get advice from volunteering college students with similar backgrounds. We hope that forming these academic connections will improve equal access to information about college application process.

Key features include a Mentor page, Mentee page, and the ability to search by region, interests, college, and majors. Users can reach out to volunteer advisor through our Mentor page or create their own profile and wait to be contacted.
